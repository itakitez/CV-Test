        <p>I have been a hotel staff since I came to the united states. Since the recent pandemic happened, it heavily hit many industries including mine.During all these two years sitting at home, on - and - off working situation. I thought, maybe
          is time
          for a career change, something that not easily be affacted by this pandemic ( such as work from home availiability). So I decided to start this online learning journey. I hope I can make a complete career change for myself and my family</p>
